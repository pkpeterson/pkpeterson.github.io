# Current Members
We are looking for prospective students, who are excited about environmental science, chemistry, and fieldwork. While prior computer programming experience is not required, a familiarity with or willingness to learn Python is a plus. If you are a Whittier College student and are interested in joining us,  please contact Prof. Peterson in person or by email to set up a meeting.
