The Peterson Lab studies the remote sensing of atmospheric trace gas and aerosol vertical profiles to better understand processes associated with air quality and climate change in urban environments. We primarily focus on the use of novel spectroscopic techniques, such as Multiple Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS).

Research Interests
======
1. Remote sensing of atmospheric trace gases from the ground and aircraft
1. Impacts of climate change and land use changes on air quality in urban environments
1. Tropospheric halogen chemistry with a focus on the polar regions

For Prospective Members
======
We are looking for prospective researchers, who are excited about environmental chemistry, spectroscopy, and fieldwork opportunities. If you are a Whittier College student who has taken CHEM 220B and are interested in joining us,  please contact Prof. Peterson in person or by email to set up a meeting.
